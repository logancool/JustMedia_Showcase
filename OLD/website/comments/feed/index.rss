		<description><![CDATA[While contextual advertising on TV is not a bad or crazy idea in the least, I think the technology will indeed take some catching up to make this a reality. Since TV, like the web, operates via digital signals, the content would either need to be communicated within in the signal, perhaps with tagging for contextual recognition, or as you mention, some type of speech recognition app. Like you, I am no programmer, so I don&#039;t know how close this functionality is to being usable.

In the meantime, I would like to see cable networks increase interactive capabilities. We are starting to see interactive functionality, but it is rather rudimentary and doesn&#039;t always operate as expected. With the maturation of this technology, I think we will see some creative uses of mixed mediums. In addition to television beginning to tie in web functionality, our mobile devices are just starting to really be able to interact with traditional mediums like television and there is some amazing opportunity for innovation and engaging communications.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Without consistent support from the advertising community InformationWeek will not exist in print. That ship has sailed. 

The model is broken and it is not realistic to expect quality content/great journalism if the economics don&#039;t work. Many recent issues of Sports Illustrated have had only 10-15 pages of advertising. The economics don&#039;t work for SI either. The larger questions are:

1. Can publishers of high quality journalism innovate and find business models that lead to revenue and profit growth? Unfortunately, surprisingly few innovations have happened even though this trend has been unfolding for well over a decade.

2. If the economics can&#039;t be fixed what happens to high quality journalism that really impacts people and society?  I am pretty sure blogs, agenda driven journalism, and reality TV are not the answer.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[In many cases the media sales rep will not be the one providing the contract for signature - it will come from the &quot;business office.&quot;  As such, be sure to walk through any contract with the sales rep to ensure it matches with their proposal and your expectations.  Additionally, always try to strip out extraneous language in the contract that does not relate to the lead generation program (often times vendors use a &quot;one size fits all&quot; contract that includes language completely unrelated to the program being negotiated).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think it&#039;s great that radio is still in the advertising game. It sort of assuring that we&#039;re not too advanced to digest a medium that only has audio output. Yes, we&#039;re still human!

I guess I shouldn&#039;t act so surprised, I already believe there will be a need for traditional forms of advertising for the rest of time. Being a printer who only manufactures decal stickers, car wraps, and banners  you would think the &quot;digital advertising age&quot; would have us shaking in our boots. Quite the opposite is true, there is still a massive need for good old physical marketing. Just as there is still a wide spread use of radio shows &amp; radio ads.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[As someone who took a symbolic logic class, but is totally not a lawyer, I find contracts to almost go out of their way to be confusing.  I&#039;ve read so many horror stories when it comes to lead gen.  One of many reasons I&#039;m glad my team does lead gen internally (getting potential leads from places like Hoovers and LeadFerret, and converting them ourselves).  I know not everyone has the luxury of doing that, but I&#039;m super glad I do.]]></description>
